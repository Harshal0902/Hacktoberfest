<br>
<p>Fizz Buzz is a very simple programming task, asked in software developer job interviews.</p>
<p><strong>A typical round of Fizz Buzz can be:</strong>
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 and for multiples of ‘3’ print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of ‘5’ print “Buzz” & if number is divisible by both '3' & '5', print "FizzBuzz" instead.</p>
