## Important:

For Security Purposes, We can nnot provide email. This NodeJS app is a tested app. In order to use it you need to REPLACE 
``` user: 'yourMail@gmail.com', pass: 'YourREALPassword' ```  
in **app.js** file.

**Note: If You're using GMAIL, you will need to turn ON `LESS SECURE APPS` under settings. Google do not consider NodeJS module to be 'safe', so allow access to `LESS SECURE APPS` Like this ⬇️
